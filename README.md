The goal of the project is to deploy on our server, a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
We won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

## Description
The final product will have a complete web application composed of:
* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## The Command Interpreter 
AKA The Console will be able to:
* create our data model
* manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
* store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from our console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI we will build later, we won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

This abstraction will also allow us to change the type of storage easily without updating all of our codebase.

The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine
